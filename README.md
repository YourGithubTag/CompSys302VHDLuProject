# Computer Systems Engineering 302 project

This project was to create a Flappy bird clone on an FPGA development board. 
Overall, working in Quartus with Version Control isn't a great idea, and we ran into many issues over IP configs and other issues, thus there is no real release which can be built. Overall this project was a great project to work on, with hands on RTL Design experience
